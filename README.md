# Vasttrafik( Västtrafik ) Trip Planner

## Technologies used: TypeScript, NodeJS/Express and Axios

### This application uses Västtrafik´s APIs to make requests using Axios. By entering a stop, address or location in both search fields you can get a trip starting from that time. You can also change so that you can determine the time and date but also if you want to arrive at a specific time. In addition, you can swap the values of both input fields with a button, all stops are saved in a JSON file and updated once a day. Also the accesstoken is updated because it is valid for one hour, after that a new one is generated.

#### Instructions to start the project
1. `npm install`
2. `nodemon index.js`
3. `To see the magic, just type localhost:3000 in to your browser`
